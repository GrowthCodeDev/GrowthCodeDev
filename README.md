## 🧭 Code Philosophy

> **Code is read more often than it is written.**

- Clarity over cleverness  
- Simple > complex  
- Explicit over implicit  
- Small, composable modules  
- Meaningful naming and structure  
- No magic, no unnecessary abstraction  

I aim for code that:
- Can be understood months later  
- Is easy to extend or refactor  
- Solves a real problem  
- Respects performance and resources  

Documentation and structure are **not optional**.
